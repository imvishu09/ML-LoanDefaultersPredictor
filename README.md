# Loan Status Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to predict loan approval status based on various applicant characteristics using machine learning models. It provides a user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter to collect applicant information and instantly display the predicted loan outcome.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares a real-world loan dataset for model training.
- **Machine Learning Models:**  Experiments with Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Utilizes RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model performance.
- **Tkinter GUI:**  A simple interface for users to input loan details and receive predictions.

## Project Structure

- **`loan_prediction.csv`:** The dataset used for training and evaluation.
- **`loan_status_predict`:**  The trained Random Forest model saved using `joblib`.
- **`gui.py`:** The Python script containing the Tkinter GUI code.
- **`model_training.ipynb` (or `.py`): The code for data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/loan-status-prediction.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt 
   ```

3. **Run the GUI:**
   ```bash
   python gui.py
   ```
   - A window will appear. Enter the required applicant details.
   - Click "Predict" to see the loan status prediction.

## Important Notes

- **Model:** The currently deployed model is a Random Forest classifier. 
- **Data:** The dataset used may require additional exploration and cleaning for optimal results.
- **Model Evaluation:**  Model performance metrics are calculated in the `model_training` file and can be reviewed for accuracy assessment.



## Potential Improvements (for future work)

- **Error Handling:** Add error checks in the GUI to handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values).
- **Data Exploration:**  Conduct more in-depth EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to gain insights into the data and potentially engineer more features.
- **Model Selection:** Explore other models and tuning techniques to further improve prediction accuracy.
- **GUI Enhancements:** Add input validation, better visual design, and potentially more user feedback.
